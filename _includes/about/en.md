Hi, I'm Shengliang DENG. I'm currently an MPhil student at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Heming CUI](https://www.cs.hku.hk/~heming). While doing research in computer systems and networking, I'm also interested in [brain-computer interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainâ€“computer_interface), [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) and how our brains work.

In my blog, I'll try sharing technical stuff and interesting things I learn, wish you can find something helpful!
