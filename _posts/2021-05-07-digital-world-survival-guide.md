I'm kind of obsessed with survival videos recently, and watched ...
One day it occurs to me that, we're all living well in modern cities or villages, well equipped. We may not quite often to face hunger, thirst, beast, etc.
However, most of my time is spent in surviving in the digital world:
finding useful information; trying to finish my experiments; keeping my file synced; etc.
Most of our survival skills have been taught and shared by our parents, parents, etc.
However, in terms of digital world, the world brought by computers, mobile phones, the Internet, it's not often the case we can easily observe how others are doing.
We face multiple problems in the digital world:
* graduate students (like me) who have to run experiments on computers. not only computer science students, but also those in neuroscience (like my girl friend), biology, mathematics, etc.
* programmers who have to debug. Yes, bugs! They do not only live in jungles where Bear Grylls go through, but also source codes we develop, softwares we encounter, etc. They can easily turn a pleasant experiment to days of trying...
* You may loose your files.
* You are info-bombed.

Now I try to introduce most good experiences I have in surviving in the digital world (maybe then thrive?).
Some may be biased, but it's okay and would be great if you find better suggestions!
